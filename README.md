# Implementing TRed Efficiently

- All this work is done in the scope of the Spring 2020 Independent Study (CISC 5001) Class in the Computer Science Department of Brooklyn College. 
- This semester, the TRed (Tandem Repeats Detector) C++ program has been analyzed and upgraded to improve execution speed.
- The **TRed Version [v4.0](#release-v40) and [v4.1-alpha](#release-v41-alpha)** programs were released.

## Release v4.1-alpha

Release v4.1-alpha (Suffix arrays version) is at

[https://github.com/mary060196/CISC5001_Research_Project_Implementing_TRed_Efficiently/releases/tag/v4.1-alpha](https://github.com/mary060196/CISC5001_Research_Project_Implementing_TRed_Efficiently/releases/tag/v4.1-alpha)

**Note**: The program at this version runs **longer** than the program at version v4.0. It is advised to use the v4.0 release of the program (see below) for maximum execution speed.

## Release v4.0

Release v4.0 (Multi-threaded version) is at

[https://github.com/mary060196/CISC5001_Research_Project_Implementing_TRed_Efficiently/releases/tag/v4.0](https://github.com/mary060196/CISC5001_Research_Project_Implementing_TRed_Efficiently/releases/tag/v4.0)
