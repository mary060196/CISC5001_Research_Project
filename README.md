# Implementing TRed Efficiently

- All this work is done in the scope of the Spring 2020 Independent Study (CISC 5001) Class in the Computer Science Department of Brooklyn College. 
- This semester, the TRed (Tandem Repeats Detector) C++ program has been analyzed and upgraded to improve execution speed.
- The **TRed Version [v4.0](#release-v40) and [v4.1-alpha](#release-v41-alpha)** programs were released.
- See newest release: **TRed Version [v4.1.1-alpha](#release-v411-alpha)**.

## Release v4.1.1-alpha

Release v4.1.1-alpha (Suffix arrays version: Default Setting) is at

[https://github.com/mary060196/CISC5001_Research_Project_Implementing_TRed_Efficiently/releases/tag/v4.1.1-alpha](https://github.com/mary060196/CISC5001_Research_Project_Implementing_TRed_Efficiently/releases/tag/v4.1.1-alpha)

**Note**: The program at this version runs **longer** than the program at version v4.0.1. It is advised to use the v4.0.1 release of the program (see below) for maximum execution speed.

## Getting Started

To clone the repository, enter

    git clone https://github.com/mary060196/CISC5001_Research_Project_Implementing_TRed_Efficiently

in your command-line application. Afterwards, `cd` into the repository.

Then, select the branch related to the release you wish to view (either `multi-threaded` or `suffix-array`) and type

    git checkout multi-threaded
    
or

    git checkout suffix-array
    
respectively, to enter the branch and view the most recent source code + usage instructions.

Alternatively, choose the relevant release from above and download a zipped (`.zip`) or tarred (`tar.gz`) folder containing the program to your device.
